Because moves in Pokemon are extremely varied and there are many special cases, this analysis cannot take into account every single move perfectly. Here is a non-comprehensive list of things it misses but that cannot be accounted for (either because they are too variable or not quantifiable):
- It is better to be immune to move types that have more dangerous secondary effects (e.g. Poison).
- It is slightly better to be weak to 2-turn moves than 1-turn moves, because you can react to them by dynamaxing.
- It is slightly worse to be weak to moves without recoil than moves with recoil, because it means that your opponent is more likely to be hurt when they significantly damage you.
- It is slightly better to resist draining moves, since it means giving your opponent less healing.
- It is slightly better to resist Grass-, Electric-, or Psychic-type moves, and slightly worse to resist Dragon-type moves, because of the possiblity of a terrain being active.
- The moves Darkest Lariat and Sacred Sword ignore defense and evasion stat changes, and so deal a slightly different expected amount of damage than their base power would suggest. (How different and in which direction depends on whether your enemies are more likely to incur positive or negative stat changes in those categories, which varies.)
- The moves Body Slam, Stomp, Astonish, Extrasensory, Dragon Rush, Shadow Force, Heat Crash, Heavy Slam, Phantom Force, and Flying Press are slightly better than the analysis would otherwise suggest because they are guaranteed to hit a Pokemon that has used Minimize and deal double damage to such a Pokemon.
- The move Dragon Darts has complicated interactions based on both Pokemon on your team, and may deal damage even if you are immune to it, or deal half damage.
